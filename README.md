## Sprint 2: Statistical Tests and Experiments
The goal is to analyse once run, online Udacity A/B test results! <br/>

### **INTRODUCTION**
 ### Problem statement:
 Students get frustrated during the 14 days trial as they are not able to commit the required time for the course.
### Aim:

1.   Check if the change helps to reduce the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time.

2.    without  significantly reducing the number of students who continued past the free trial and eventually complete the course
3.    Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.

##### Libraries Used
``` Numpy ```
``` Pandas ```
``` Matplolib ```
``` Seaborn ```
``` Statsmodels ```
``` Scipy ```

### Conclusion

* More students enrolled inthe course in the control group than in the experiment group.
* There was no significant change in the rate at which students made at least one payment given a click.
* The retention rate for the experiment group is higher than it the control group, which means that there were less frustrated students in the course
